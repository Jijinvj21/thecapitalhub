            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Once upon a time, in the bustling world of startups, Pramod
              embarked on an exciting journey. He found himself in the company
              of passionate founders brimming with optimistic ideas. As he
              delved deeper, he realized that building visionary products was
              only the beginning of their adventure. These brilliant minds faced
              a daunting challenge - raising funds!
            </p>
            <p>
              In the year 2021, a whopping $42 billion was raised by startups in
              India, and the global funding frenzy reached a staggering $621
              billion. Yet, a puzzling 30% of these funds eluded the grasp of
              new early-stage startups.
            </p>
            <p>
              The founders' quest for the perfect Strategic Angel Investors
              became the stuff of legends. They yearned for more than just
              capital; they craved the magic of networking and the wisdom of
              mentorship to turn their dreams into realities.
            </p>
            <p>That's why we started The Capital HUB</p>
