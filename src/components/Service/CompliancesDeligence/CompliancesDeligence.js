                Commercial due diligence
              </h1>
              <p>
                Commercial due diligence (CDD) seeks to understand the seller’s
                commercial prospects based on a detailed analysis of the
                company’s business and the broader industry(s) in which it
                operates. This review provides the purchaser with an insight
                into the credibility of the company’s forecasts.
                <br />
                While the specifics of CDD will always be tailored to the unique
                circumstances of the seller’s business, common aspects of CDD
                include:
              </p>
              <li>
                <div>

              <li>
                <div>
                  Analyzing the seller’s competitors and understanding the
                  strengths and weaknesses of the seller’s strategy against both

              <h1 className="element_underline_three">Legal Due Diligence</h1>
              <p>
                The scope and emphasis of legal due diligence (LDD) will very
                much depend on the specifics of the seller’s business and the
                areas of legal risk that have been identified by the buyer and
                their legal advisors.
                <br />
                For example, if a seller operated in, say, the aged care sector,
                a key area of LDD would be around the company’s current and
                historical compliance with the onerous regulatory obligations of
                that specific industry.
                <br />
                Nevertheless, there are common areas of LDD that apply to most
                companies. These include a review of the following:

              <li>

              </h1>
              <p>
                The role of financial due diligence (FDD) is to provide an
                acquirer with a level of comfort around the integrity of the
                financial information provided by the seller, particularly in
                relation to the seller’s financial performance and position.
                <br />
                Those charged with undertaking FDD will engage with the seller
                to better understand the historical and forecast financial
                performance of the business and the accounting and financial
                systems that the business has in place
                <br />
                At the beginning of the due diligence process, the FDD team will
                formally seek a range of information and material from the
                seller including annual reports, audit files (if available),
                management accounts, tax returns, business plans and forecasts,
                board papers, and so on.
                <br />
                <br />
                Key areas of the FDD report will include:
              </p>

                <div>An analysis of the company’s historical performance</div>{" "}

              <p>
                As part of the due diligence process, an acquirer will conduct a
                review of the company’s management team to determine its
                strengths and weaknesses, assess whether there are any gaps in
                skills and experience, and also consider the extent of
                key-person risk.
                <br /> <br />
                Another more intangible consideration will be trying to assess
                the prevailing corporate culture within the seller’s business
                and whether it will be relatively easy to integrate management
                and staff into the new business and what the challenges of doing
                so might be.
